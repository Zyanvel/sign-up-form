# Intro component with sign up form project

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for being here.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this introductory component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## What will you need to start coding? 
 
- Code editor like Visual Studio Code
- A css color picker like slurp or color picker (both are free!)
- Mobile and Website designs (also attached on each ticket depending on the task) https://www.figma.com/file/RISX0oC8DvLbU2yQh0Krlo/Design?node-id=0%3A1


## Where to find everything

You will find all the required assets in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
